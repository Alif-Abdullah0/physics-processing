## PHYSICS SEESAW CATAPULT SIMULATOR

You THERE! Yes, you! Ever dreamed of launching things on a seesaw?  
Of COURSE YOU HAVE! WELL, know you can (virtually speaking, of course).  
Defy physics as you simulate the physics of dropping things and launching  
things at a magic green goal!  
  
You have the power to move the goal, with our handy, dandy, nifty, difty  
slider, right next to the green goal! Click it, drag it up and down, and  
kablammo! The goal will MOVE! Exciting!  
  
Sliders are pretty self-explanator. Move them to change values such as  
* mass  
* distance from fulcrum  
* drop height  
NEXT!  
  
Tracker in the top right, tracker knows what is best, tracker in the top  
right, tracker will do the rest! Your government-mandated tracker  
resides in the top right, tracking the distance of the launched yellow  
block from the goal, the yellow block's vertical and horizontal velocity!  
YAY!  

That's all for now, folks!
