## PHYSICS SEESAW CATAPULT SIMULATOR

You THERE! Yes, you! Ever dreamed of launching things on a seesaw?  Of COURSE YOU HAVE! WELL, know you can (virtually speaking, of course).  Defy physics as you simulate the physics of dropping things 
and launching things at a magic green goal!

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE: 
* Each pixel on the y-axis of the world covers 2 meters. Each pixel in the x-axis of the world covers 1 meter.  
* The program works in realtime. Objects move how they would in real life over the same time intervals.  
* The mass of the plank is 0.1 kg. The plank is 200 meters long. The mass of the yellow block is 1 kg.  


SHENANIGANS:
You have the power to move the goal, with our handy, dandy, nifty, difty slider, right next to the green goal! Click it, drag it up and down, and kablammo! The goal will MOVE! Exciting!

Sliders are pretty self-explanatory. Move them to change values such as * mass * distance from fulcrum * drop height NEXT!

Tracker in the top right, tracker knows what is best, tracker in the top right, tracker will do the rest! Your government-mandated tracker resides in the top right, tracking the distance of the launched yellow block from the 
goal, the yellow block's vertical and horizontal velocity!  YAY!

That's all for now, folks!
