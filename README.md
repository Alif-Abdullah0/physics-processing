## PHYSICS SEESAW CATAPULT SIMULATOR

You THERE! Yes, you! Ever dreamed of launching things on a seesaw?  Of COURSE YOU HAVE! WELL, know you can (virtually speaking, of course). Command physics as you simulate the physics of dropping things and launching things at a magic green goal!

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE: 
* Each pixel on the y-axis of the world covers 2 meters. Each pixel in the x-axis of the world covers 1 meter.  
* The program does not work according to our time scale - it is sped up to make the simulation occur quicker.
* The mass of the plank is 0.1 kg. The plank is 200 meters long. The mass of the yellow block is 1 kg. These values were chosen at Angela's whim.
* The range of values for the sliders were chosen so it would be easier for users to win the game.

RELEVANT SHENANIGANS:
1) Goal: You have the power to move the goal, with our handy, dandy, nifty, difty slider, right next to the green goal! Click it, drag it up and down, and kablammo! The goal will MOVE! Exciting stuff!
2) Sliders: The sliders are pretty self-explanatory. We have three of them! Move them to change values such as  
* dropped block mass  
* dropped block's distance from fulcrum  
* drop height of block  
NEXT!  
3) Trackers: Tracker in the top right, tracker knows what is best, tracker in the top right, tracker will do the rest! Your government-mandated tracker resides in the top right, tracking the distance of the launched yellow block from the goal, the yellow block's vertical and horizontal velocity!  YAY!
* Note that the distance tracker will calculate the distance between the top left corner of the goal and the top left corner of the block.
That's all for now, folks!
